## Development

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The easiest way to get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer is to use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

I use [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) during this development. It is a pretty cool little tool that will speed up your development process.

#### From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/rbiggers/electron-pandora.git
# Go into the repository
cd electron-pandora
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
# Run the app in debug mode
npm dev
# Run the app with nodemon

# Run the app with nodemon in debug mode
