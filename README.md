## Development

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The easiest way to get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer is to use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

I used [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for this development. It is a pretty cool little tool that will help speed up your development process.
